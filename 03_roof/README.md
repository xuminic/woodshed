# The Roof Structure and Frames

This shed has a single sloping roof design. 
It's simpler and lighter than a pitched roof.
You don't have to cut the Colorbond roof sheet.
However it's also not as strong as a pitched roof 
so first of all is to install a roof structure to enhance its wind resistance.
The roof structure is combined by 12 triangle supports and 2 cross-over beams.
The plan can be found at <a href="plan_overhead.dxf">plan_overhead.dxf</a>

Please ignore the joinsts in B-B and D-D currently. They are not part of the roof structure but 
made ready for the shelf frames.

The triangle supports are installed in the top of the wall frames.
The cross-over beam in 4-4 and 8-8 are embeded into the wall frames.

Each beam is combined by two 90x45 structural pines. 
I use the PVC glue and three M12 bolts to hold them together.
This structure can greatly improve the strength of the shed like a cage.
Actually the shed can hold stand even the whole roof had been removed or replaced by other design.

Here is the details of the root structure.

The roof frame is installed in the front wall. There's nothing in the back wall.
All rafters are neiled on the top of the roof frame and the top of the back wall.
Here is the structure of the roof frame.

When the roof frame is installed on the front wall, the whole structure is:

The plan can be found at <a href="elevation_roof_front.dxf">elevation_roof_front.dxf</a>.

The roof frame is combined by three panels, just like the wall frames, which nailed together
and neiled onto the front wall frames.
