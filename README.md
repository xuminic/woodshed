This project shares my plan, progress and experience to build a small garden shed 
with wood frames and cladding. The roof is ColorBond metal and the foundation is
post anchor and concrete. The area is roughly 6 meters by 2.4 meters and the height
is 3 meters. The BOM budget was $4000 AUD and apparently was overrun, 
not sure the detail number, perhaps by 30%-40%. 

Most important part in this project is the plan made with LibreCAD. 
If you are a computer monkey who knows CAD software pretty well, and willing to
do some manual work in your backyard to kill some weekends, this project could be
a good start for you. You can easily shape it to fit your purpose.
If you don't know how to use LibreCAD, you may still find some useful references
from this project. I'll also export some PDF file from the plan.

## Motivation

I need a shed to host garden tools, being storage room and a sometime study room.
Metal shed is cheap but need the concrete slab to be assembled. Some wood sheds 
can be purchased from store. But they are not suitable for the slope.
Apparently whatever I do I need to build a flat foundation first. The easiest
way to build a foundation is deck foundation, just some anchor posts and timbers.
Naturally it would be quite strong if stick some timber frames on the timber
foundation and a shed could come into being, just need to do some detail design.
LibreCAD is a cross platform open sourced 2D CAD software which is perfect for 
my purpose. It supports layers so you can easily see through different profiles.
It is also convenient to design something not available in Internet, like this
one, had a 3:1 length width ratio.

When you get into the construction, do not forget to wear the proper protections
like helmet, goggles, etc. Be extremely careful with power saws and air tools,
which could easily cut some fingers off in no time. Be extremely careful with 
power lines, which could cause fire or even electrocution. Keep kids and dogs away
from work site.

Before you start, check with your local council to make sure the shed can be legally built.
Different council has different regulations regarding to the dimension.

The frame section is 90x35mm and the space is based on 600mm, which is commonly 
used in house building. However I do not know how strong it can resist against the wind
so please do not build it in tornado area.
