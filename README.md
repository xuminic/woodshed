# Wood Shed -- Howto build a wood shed

![Figure 1-1](images/final_view_front.jpg "Front View")

This project shares my plan, progress and experience to build a small garden shed 
with wood frames and cladding. The roof is ColorBond metal and the foundation is
post anchor and concrete. The BOM budget was $4000 AUD and apparently was overrun, 
not sure the detail number, perhaps 30%-40%. 

Most important part in this project is the plan made with LibreCAD. 
If you are a computer monkey who knows CAD software pretty well, and willing to
do some manual work in your backyard to kill some weekends, this project could be
a good start for you. You can easily shape it to fit your purpose.
If you don't know how to use LibreCAD, you may still find some useful references
from this project. I'll also export some PDF file from the plan.

## Motivation

I need a shed to host garden tools, being storage room and a sometime study room.
Metal shed is cheap but need the concret slab to be assembled. Wood shed could be
an easy target because you can find all materials at local stores, DIY knowledges
from website and details from youtube.
