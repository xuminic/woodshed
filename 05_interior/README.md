# Interior Improvement

As a garden shed, it was ready to use after exterior cladding. 
Morever than that I did a little upgrade to make it as cosy as a sometime reading room.
The upgrade includes the interior cladding, insulation, floor tiles, utility shelf and painting.

## Interior Cladding and Insulation

There are many building materials to be installed in door as the wall. 
Wood or laminate floor for example can be nice and stylish.
I chosed the plasterboard simply because its low price and been widely used.
The trade mark of the plasterboard is Gyprock, which is made of paper and plaster.

Before installing the plasterboard sheet, I prefer to install some supports around the edge.
It's not a have-to. Many builders choose to ignore it and install the plasterboard anyway.
But I feel it would be stronger with these extra supports.

The red arrows point to the extra supports. Meanwhile all spaces between the studs were filled
with 90mm Earthwool. I don't know why I was so obsessive compulsively install the insulation
in a shed, probably by fashion. It's not expensive any way.

If you want to wire power cable behand the wall, it's time to do so before gluing the plasterboard.
Generally the plasterboard should be glued to the stud with Stud Adhesive, only the edges been nailed.

  </tr>

The joints between plasterboards will be taped with Paper Jointing Tape and filled with joint Compound.
The process was quite tedious because I have to keep pasting and sanding to get a smooth finishing.

Then the wall was painted.

## Floor Tiling

No more to say, just lay some tiles if you like, or leave it as-is.

## Utility Shelf

The utility shelf is the most important component in the shed. After all it's a storage room.
This featured shelf has the same length to the shed. It occupied a whole wall. 
The back side supports of the shelf were nailed into the stud. The front side supports were installed 
to the frame timber, which stand on the floor and nailed to the roof structure.
The shelf is rigid and heavy duty.

The width of the shelf is slightly larger than common 300mm shelf; it's almost 400mm.
I think it's more versatile to use.

First, nail the supporting beam to the studs against the wall. 
I used the 42x22mm timber as the supporting beam.

Second, install the posts. The posts are structural timber of 70x35mm. 
They stand on the floor. The ground end was nailed to a corner support.
The corner supports are also nailed to the studs. 
Note that each post must face to the studs.

  </tr>
</table>

The upper end of the posts were nailed to the roof structure.
Remember the D-D in roof rack plan? It was designed for this.

     <td align="right"><img src="img_shelf_roof_detail.jpg" width="400" alt="Roof Detail"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Third, install the joists to the posts. The posts were standing on the ground, not nailed to, 
so it's not stable in horizontal direction. The joists would fix that, meanwhile give the support
to the shelf panel. I used 35x35mm timber as the joists. The joists must be levelled to the supporting beam
on the wall.

Finally, install the shelf panel. I used the laminate floor as the shelf panel, 
just cutting them to pieces in 400mm length and splicing them on the supporting beams and joists. 
The laminate floor is thin and hard, looked very stong for the shelf.
